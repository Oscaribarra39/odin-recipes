# odin-recipes
This is one of the first practices in Odin course, the intention of this practices is to demostrate the thing i have learned so far.
At first this is going to be pretty basic, no js, no css. Just apply what i have learned, that is HTML.
But i will revisit this to add new knowledge

It is pretty easy, is a page where i have to put recipes, there are going to be like four or five pages and the index one. Easy.
